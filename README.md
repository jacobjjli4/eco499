*Work in Progress*

How did the Interstate Highway system affect intergenerational mobility in the United States? I combine a dataset of highway openings (Baum-Snow, 2007) and the Opportunity Atlas (Chetty et al., 2018) at the Commuting Zone level to investigate.

## Data
Data sources are documented in `data/raw/source.yml`. Actual data is not tracked in Git; instead, I manage it using Data Version Control with a remote repository on my computer. Data that is generated by the code (ex. cleaned or merged data) is not tracked using Data Version Control. Instead, the main do-file will create the directory `data/derived` that stores all data generated by the project.


## Code
Code is written mostly in the Stata language, with one Python script. The main do-file that runs all the code is `build.do`, which calls all code files in `code/`.
